Minimum viable example of how to use the following C libraries:

- bzip2
- zlib (gzip format)
- lz4 (frame format)
- lzma
- zstd

If you adopt some of this code for your program, the portion you copy
is probably too trivial to fall under copyright protection, so as far
as I'm concerned there's no need to worry about license notices. The
ISC license if included in this repo just in case.
